Cryomesh (and the many associated applications) was an experimental C++ platform for constructing a neural net style association of node bundles spacially linked to an energy mesh construct. Successful output would change each node and bundle and warp the energy mesh which in turn dampens or excites the node based on spacial proximity. Based on this the entire construct would learn to adapt and learn, and so be trained on sample data.
