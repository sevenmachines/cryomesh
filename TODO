HIGH ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Bundle::testChannelStructure 

* UseCasesTest, complete full basic test

* Test input pattern channels actually firing their mapped fibres in Bundle update
* Test output pattern channels being updated from their mapped fibres in Bundle update

* Document check and update state/ and utilities/

* Do full test run of Cryomesh cycle from data

MEDIUM ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Redesign database
	- NodeStructural (id, x, y, z)
	- NodeVolatile (id, cycle activity)
	
* Implement server
	- Set command defs, a keystore to allowed messaging values

* BUG: Impulses have very high start/end values
	- see

LOW -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------





WISHLIST ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Dont clear past impulses from Nodes on every cycle if extra performance is needed

DONE -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* BUG: Statistician shows all nodes as active (DONE)

* Add some decent Statistician data (DONE)

* Force Bundle and sequencer to pass pattern channels maps by reference to avoid 
losing track of uuids (DONE)

* Build the Statistician to dump useful data about a bundle (DONE)

* FibreTest::testGetNodesPattern (DONE)
	- this tests, getting the in/out nodes of the fibre, force firing them, and getting the pattern 

* Test pattern generation when querying Fibre for Input node state (DONE)
	//NOTE: Do Fibre::getInputNodesPattern actual gets the output nodes from connections, either need to (DONE)
	//- Have connections hold an input node too (BEST)
	//- Have output nodes on connections in primary output fibres
	
* NodeTest::testforceFire (DONE)

*Document check and update common/ components/ dataobjects/ manager/ and structures/ (DONE)

* Implement input pattern channels actually firing their mapped fibres in Bundle update (DONE)

* Implement output pattern channels being updated from their mapped fibres in Bundle update (DONE)

* Test Creator check structure (DONE

* Test connecting pattern channels to clusters through creator (DONE)

* Complete writing BundleTest::testConnectPatternChannels (DONE)

* Complete Creators loaddata, set primary, etc unfinished creation methods (DONE)

* Creator: Create primary fibres automatically from the datafile 
	then connect them to specific clusters in the config file	(DONE)
	
* Bundle: Add primary in/out map to bundle (DONE)

* Bundle: Create PatternChannels (DONE)

* Write tests for partial implementation of creator actual bundle creation methods (DONE)

* Implement cryomanager 'creation from config file' using Creator class (DONE)

* Add Database objects create from database entry for connection and node (DONE)
	- Create tests (DONE)

* Add updateNode/Connection functions to DatabaseManager to update 
	entries instead of creating new ones (DONE)
	- Create tests (DONE)

* Add deleteNodeByCycle/ConnectionByCycle functions to DatabaseManager (DONE)
	- Create tests (DONE)
	
* Impulses do not seem to be propogating from fibre to Nodes, see UseCasesTest (05/03/2011)
	- Impulses needed to be time reset on addition to connections otherwise they were always in the past

* Add Spherical or point co-ordinates to components. (05/03/2011)
	- Whats the local reference point inside a cluster? DONE (see below)
	- Whats the global refrence point for structural components?  DONE (see below)
	- Set a max bounding box, give each node a random point, allow for a density function if needed
	- Nodes and connections are stationary, caclulate everything on creation.
	- When impulses added to connections, use connection length
	
* Use DataObjects in Nodes and ImpulseCollection to show whats happening
	- Alter data objects so that it returns enough data (eg x,y) for database entries
	
* Use DataObjects in Nodes and ImpulseCollection to show whats happening
	- Alter data objects so that it returns enough data (eg x,y) for database entries
	
* Implement database adding of nodes and connections
	- Insert node with equal id overwrites or is it a new entry with a diferent cycle?
	- NodeDatabaseObject (DONE)
	- Node::getDatabaseObject (DONE)
	- ConnectionDatabaseObject (DONE)
	- Connection::getDatabaseObject (DONE)
